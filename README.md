Here it is, my profile.  Nice isn't it?  I've been a software developer at Nationwide for over 20 years, working primarily in .Net, Java, and Angular (Typescript, Javascript).  All of my work is on private, line-of-business apps, so there really arent' any public examples of my work.

On a personal level, I'm into running, cycling, wood working, following the sport of Sumo, raising my Savannah cats, learning Italian, and anything else that interests me!
